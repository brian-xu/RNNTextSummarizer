Scripts/Functions written by our team:
-summarize function. Takes in text and uses the inference model to predict summaries. (4 lines)
-softmax function. Takes the softmax of x. (3 lines)
-top_k_sampling function. Samples a token based on the top-k tokens. (7 lines)
-top_words function. Takes in text and returns the top words in that text. Used in Luhn's summarizer.
-calculate_scores function. Takes in words and significance and returns the score. Used in Luhn's summarizer.
